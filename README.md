Running `main.py` generates the figures presented in the paper.
`lyapunov_bisection_search.py` generates results related to the existence of a Lyapunov function for a given method, in a folder called `results/lyapunov`.
`cycle_bisection_search.py` generates results related to the existence of a cycle of a given length for a given method, in a folder called `results/cycle`.
Running `tools/file_management.py` generates the figures from the data generated by both `lyapunov_bisection_search.py` and `cycle_bisection_search.py`.
